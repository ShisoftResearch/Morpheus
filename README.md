# Morpheus

General Purpose Graph Engine. Aimed to solve most of the graph related problems in one system.

## Introduction

### Features and `works to do`

* High-performance in-memory distributed graph data store
* Query directed, indirected, simple (pointer) edges in one vertex
* `Morpheus query language` (S-Expresion)
* Deepth-first-search (paths to, adjacent lists, `updates`)
* Breadth-first-search (`shortest path`)
* `PageRank (traversal and bulk approaches)`
* `Graph-based data processing and streaming`
* `Node and vertices indexes`
